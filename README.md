# CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSIS

## **Overview**

This project presents an end-to-end Customer Churn Analysis built with Power BI. The dataset was cleaned, transformed and enhanced with additional columns and DAX measures to reveal patterns that influence customer churn. The final dashboard provides a clear, interactive view of customer behavior and helps businesses identify churn drivers and improve retention strategies.

## **Data Preparation**

The dataset was fully processed before visualization. Key steps include:

* Removal of duplicates
* Handling of blank and inconsistent values
* Conversion of columns to the correct data types
* Creation of new engineered fields such as Tenure Group and Revenue Category
* Development of DAX measures for KPIs and dynamic calculations

## **Key Measures Created**

* Total Customers
* Total Churned Customers
* Total Charges
* ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
* Total Calls
* Churn Rate
* Revenue Distribution Metrics

## **Dashboard Highlights**

The interactive dashboard provides insights into:

* Total customers and churned customers
* Customer distribution by revenue, tenure group and state
* Churn behavior based on customer service calls
* Total charges breakdown for churned and non-churned users
* Analysis of customers with voice mail and international plans
* Patterns showing why certain customers are more likely to churn

## **What This Dashboard Helps You Discover**

* Who is churning and when
* Which segment has the highest churn rate
* Which states have the highest churn contribution
* How customer service interactions impact churn
* How revenue and tenure affect customer loyalty

## **Tools Used**
